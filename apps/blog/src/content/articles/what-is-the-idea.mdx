Background
"After COVID, students learning gap in math extremely increased."

</FancyParagraph>


National Center for Education Statistics shows a meager **74 percent** of eighth graders show no proficiency in math, increased from 66 percent in 2019(Mervosh, 2022). Its research shows that the average student in American K-12 schools is **five months** behind in math and four months behind in reading. We believe currently there is no outstanding solution to solve this problem due to it’s high private tutoring cost, high math teacher to students ratio and high learning gap.  It motivated our team to build a math education platform provides personalized AI education to students through analyzing it’s learning gap.

# What is HackMath
**HackMath** is AI-platform where students can stay on track through customized Learning

**1. Individual Assessment**

When a student first joins HackMath, they take an assessment quiz. This quiz helps the AI understand the student’s current level of knowledge and areas of strength and weakness in Math.

**2. Tailored Lessons**

Based on the results of the assessment quiz, the AI customizes the learning content to match the student’s specific needs. This means that the lesson plan isn’t one-size-fits-all; it adapts to the student’s learning pace and understanding.

**3. Interactive Learning Experience**

The AI tutor, named Dr. Ham, engages students through interactive lessons that make learning Math fun and engaging. This interactive component keeps students motivated and enhances their learning experience.

**4. Continuous Analysis and Adaptation**

As the student progresses through the lessons, the AI continually analyzes their performance and learning gaps. This ongoing analysis allows the AI to adjust the curriculum dynamically, ensuring that the student is always challenged just enough to learn effectively without feeling overwhelmed.

**5. Feedback Through Analytics**

HackMath includes an analytics tab that provides feedback on the student’s progress. This feature allows students (and potentially their teachers or parents) to see tangible proof of improvement and areas that need more attention.

**6. Categories of Learning**
The AI Customized Learning in HackMath is divided into three categories:
- Conceptual: Understanding the underlying concepts of Math topics.
- Procedural: Learning how to apply these concepts through mathematical procedures or steps.
- Application: Applying learned concepts and procedures to solve real-world problems.
