  It all started with a discord call. Min (the genius) thought of a platform to teach high school students Math using AI. The initial fire was

I (Montek) was trusted by Min, to start building this platform. I was suprised to see Min had all the designed plan in a Figma File._createMdxContent
The design was for a mobile app, I recommended starting with a web based plaform and then later moving to other platforms ( also cause I hate mobile dev).
